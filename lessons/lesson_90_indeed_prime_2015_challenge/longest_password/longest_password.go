/*
 * You would like to set a password for a bank account. However, there are three restrictions on the format of the password:
 * 
 * it has to contain only alphanumerical characters (aâˆ’z, Aâˆ’Z, 0âˆ’9);
 * there should be an even number of letters;
 * there should be an odd number of digits.
 * You are given a string S consisting of N characters. String S can be divided into words by splitting it at, and removing, the spaces. The goal is to choose the longest word that is a valid password. You can assume that if there are K spaces in string S then there are exactly K + 1 words.
 * 
 * For example, given "test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1", there are five words and three of them are valid passwords: "5", "a0A" and "pass007". Thus the longest password is "pass007" and its length is 7. Note that neither "test" nor "?xy1" is a valid password, because "?" is not an alphanumerical character and "test" contains an even number of digits (zero).
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * 
 * func Solution(S string) int
 * 
 * that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns the length of the longest word from the string that is a valid password. If there is no such word, your function should return âˆ’1.
 * 
 * For example, given S = "test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1", your function should return 7, as explained above.
 * 
 * Assume that:
 * 
 * N is an integer within the range [1..200];
 * string S consists only of printable ASCII characters and spaces.
 * In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
